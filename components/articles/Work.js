            <p>I've always been interested in quantitative finance, so this project allowed me to explore that intersection of CS and business. Initially I trained a model through the 
                <a href="https://pullpush.io/" target="_blank"> PushShift </a>torrents, which let me compare historical market data to sentiment (measured by HuggingFace) on Reddit that day for a particular
                ticker. Eventually, because my model was longer-term (i.e. not updating every second), I switched from a Selenium/BeautifulSoup hybrid collection
                model to the pushpull.io API directly. I've backtested the algorithm (with historical data) and it beat the market by 39% yearly, 
                but I'm aware that a live version won't produce as-stellar results.

                posts in mind for other organizations. I couldn't get the snowflakes to sit right manually, so I looked into the 
                 <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/api" target="_blank"> Figma API</a> and found that it would be possible to make a snowflake
                 generator plugin. The result was a plugin that used Perlin noise to generate a pattern of snowflakes, customizable by
                 number of objects, size, and spread.

            <p>A personal interest of mine has been food insecurity and its effects on the homelessness cycle.
                My team and I designed and implemented a MySQL database that contained information on clients, dietary needs,
                nearby resources that provided those foods and their prices, and the nutritional information of those foods. We also created useful functions
                to aggregate commonly accessed data and help nutritionists best meet their clients' needs.

                may not have the resources to accurately inform their unique food needs. After tedious research to accurately determine
                user needs and goals, we prototyped our fully interactive app in Figma and prepared an accompanying presentation.

                <li>Determined objectives and key results and identified the risks and assumptions we made</li>
